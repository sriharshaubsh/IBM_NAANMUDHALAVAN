Problem Definition:
Chatbot deployment refers to the process of making a chatbot, also known as a conversational agent or virtual assistant, available for use by end-users or customers. It involves taking a chatbot from the development and testing phase and making it accessible through various communication channels or platforms, such as websites, mobile apps, messaging apps, or voice assistants.
 The project involves creating a chatbot using IBM Cloud Watson Assistant. The goal is to develop a virtual guide that assists users on messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and Slack. The chatbot should provide helpful information, answer frequently asked questions (FAQs), and offer a friendly conversational experience. The project includes designing the chatbot's persona, configuring responses, integrating with messaging platforms, and ensuring a seamless user experience.
Chatbot deployment is a critical phase in the lifecycle of a chatbot project, as it marks the transition from development to real-world use. A well-executed deployment ensures that the chatbot delivers the intended benefits, such as improved customer support, automation of routine tasks, and enhanced user experiences. It also involves ongoing monitoring and maintenance to keep the chatbot performing optimally and meeting user expectations.

Design Thinking: 

Design thinking is a user-centered approach to problem-solving and innovation. When applying design thinking principles to chatbot deployment, the focus is on creating a chatbot that not only functions well but also meets the needs and expectations of its users. Here's a design thinking framework for chatbot deployment:
